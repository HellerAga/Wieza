<p>Analyze the digital collection of  The Tower, a student newspaper from a Catholic university, covering 2019 to 2022. Use Nielsen’s usability heuristic framework to provide recommendations for improving information retrieval and overall user experience(Nielsen,1994a). Additionally, examine the system’s functionality in browsing and searching for specific digital content.</p>
<br>Step 1- Examine the input and output of the system.</br>
<p>
<table>
<table border=1>
<tr>
 <td>Input</td>
 <td>Output</td>
</tr>

<tr>
      <td>Election</td>
      <td>55 pages with articles and editorials. An example: The 2020 Elections Are Heating Up for America, January 23, 2019.Consistency and standards: The image above the article is included twice.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
      <td>Presidential debate 2020</td> 
      <td>6 pages with articles and editorials. Some examples: The 2020 Presidential Debates: Can They Swing the Election? October 16, 2020. Quill By Megan Leibfreid. Consistency and standard: The article was published twice, on October 1, 2020, and October 16, 2020, each time with a different image. The following articles are the first output the users will see. Only 2 of the ten links are active—the other links direct users to an inactive Zoom page.
<br>The Final Curtain: Trump and Biden Offer Conflicting Perspectives In Final Debate Marked by Great Dissension, October 30, 2020. Many links,e.g., CBSNews.com., www.npr.org, YouTube NBC News Live,Politico.</br>
Kellyanne Conway Speaks on A Divided America on Campus  March 31, 2022. Consistency and standards: The photo is overwhelming and not proportional to the text. No links.<br> Fox News Fighting to MaintianDominance, February 4, 2022.Consistency and standard: The article has 15 links.</br>
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
      <td>Pandemic</td>
      <td>33 pages with articles. An example: How’s the Economy Looking? – A Brief Overview, March 27, 2020. (page 33:last page). Consistency and standard: no links. The organization of the articles is inconsistent;e.g., the first article is dated April 15, 2021, and the next page contains articles from 2020 to 2024. Page 4 features articles from 2022 that include words about the pandemic.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
      <td>Diversity</td>
      <td>13 pages with articles and editorials. An example: Controversial Activist Abby Johnson Invited to Virtual Campus: “What it Means to Be Pro-Life” Under Debate, February 12, 2021</td> 
</tr>

<p>Step 2-Analyzing the site by incorporating source material into a lesson plan for an undergraduate course, Family Diversity in America, using Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics. The lesson plan includes original information sources students can retrieve from the Tower digital collection. The sources must consist of the context of diversity in understanding family-related social problems and social policies.</p>
<br>The top 2 weaknesses of the system are as follows:</br>
<ol>
<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use.
The system lacks filters for browsing, sorting, and modifiers, i.e., date range, section, type, and sort by relevance. Results after typing “family diversity” in a search box are disappointing. Many articles and sources are unrelated to the actual search. 
The articles’ hierarchy is inconsistent, and related stories should be suggested in the navigations. Some articles are long, and separating parts with a relevant image might enhance readability and benefit nero-divergent users.</li>
<li>Consistency and standards.
The articles’ hierarchy is inconsistent, and related stories should be suggested in the navigations. Some articles are long, and separating parts with a relevant image might enhance readability and benefit nero-divergent users. Overall, many articles have issues with consistency and standards. Images and photos don’t include captions. This negatively affects students who use screen readers. Some images are oversized and not proportional to the text and, therefore, might be a distracting and disengaging factor in students’ understanding of the text content. </li>
</ol>
<br>The top 2 strengths of the system are as follows:</br>
<ol>
<li>Match between the system and the real world.
The content is accessible and easy to read because the language style is consistent with the one the students use. Embedding information sources (articles) with interactive links to social media or campus groups allows students to develop critical thinking. A wide range of comments (some might be controversial and not fact-based) from the local community can be used to facilitate discussion about diversity. The following article, with its embedded comments and links, is an example href="https://cuatower.com/2021/02/controversial-activist-abby-johnson-invited-to-virtual-campus-what-it-means-to-be-pro-life-under-debate" 
</li>
<li>Aesthetics.
The Toweraesthetics is a reminiscence of a print newspaper, with its black title letters on a white background. The color scheme, graphics, and font size are consistent throughout the digital collection. Students will likely find the interface visually attractive, allowing them to stay focused and entertained while browsing for information relevant to their class subject. Horizontal, wider-than-usual text columns can be considered an aesthetic advantage by some end-users.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p> Summary.
<br>A heuristic analysis of the system and mini usability test observations resulted in similar conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the system. Efficiency, standards, and consistency were why the end-user was frustrated with the amount of irrelevant data that came up as a search result. The end-user gave up after being discouraged by the number of irrelevant articles displayed and with none within the World War II context. It was only after typing "Second World War" in a search bar that she was able to retrieve needed information ( Anthropology Department Looks for Those Missing in Action, an article from November 18, 2019. In conclusion, the system requires improvement for more efficient information retrieval and browsing. Tools such as "sorting by" options and modifiers, e.g., date range, section, and type, are necessary to make the system user-friendly and efficient. Additionally, images and photos should include captions, as they are to assist users with visual impairments who use tools like screen readers. The end-user appreciated the system's aesthetics, including its overall design, horizontal text, and bold images.</br>
